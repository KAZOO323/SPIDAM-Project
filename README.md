## SPIDAM Project
The SPIDAM project is the final project for COP 2080, where students are tasked with creating a program that allows users to upload .wav and .mp3 files and view visualizations of waveform, intensity, and low/medium/high RT60 values through matplotlib graphs, for the purpose of determining the reverberation time of sound within a given room.

### Usage Instructions
Launch the program via executing view.py. Keep file uploads to .wav and .mp3- other formats have not been tested. Click the Analyze File button to generate your graphs and display your data. No edits will be made to your input file, as the program simply makes a copy for it's own use.
